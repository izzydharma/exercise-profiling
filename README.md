### Explanation

After the optimization, we can see a clear diffrence from the JMeter sample time, the method before the optimization need thousands of milisecond to run, but after the optimization the diffrence are so clear, both of the method saw a significant decrease in speed time, even reaching single digit time. This is happening because of the optimization that I did making it so that the method will run significantly faster than before optimization.

### 1. Difference between Performance Testing with JMeter and Profiling with IntelliJ Profiler
Performance testing with JMeter focuses on measuring the performance of an application under various load conditions by simulating multiple users and measuring response times, throughput, and resource utilization. It helps identify how the application behaves under stress and finds performance bottlenecks related to load handling. On the other hand, profiling with IntelliJ Profiler analyzes the internal behavior of an application to identify performance issues at the code level, such as CPU usage, memory allocation, and method execution times. It provides detailed insights into method execution times, memory usage, and CPU usage, helping to pinpoint inefficient code.

### 2. How Profiling Helps Identify Weak Points
Profiling helps identify weak points in an application by showing which methods consume the most CPU time, detecting memory leaks and excessive memory usage, monitoring thread activity to identify synchronization issues, and providing a detailed view of the application's runtime behavior. This detailed analysis helps pinpoint inefficient code and other performance issues.

### 3. Effectiveness of IntelliJ Profiler
IntelliJ Profiler is effective in assisting with analyzing and identifying bottlenecks in application code because it seamlessly integrates with the development environment, offers detailed insights into CPU, memory, and thread usage, provides an intuitive interface for analyzing performance issues, and allows for real-time monitoring and analysis of application performance.

### 4. Challenges in Performance Testing and Profiling 
The main challenges in performance testing and profiling include understanding and interpreting profiling data, performance variations between testing and production environments, and ensuring consistent results across different runs and tools. These challenges can be overcome by investing in training to understand profiling tools and data, creating a testing environment that closely mimics production, and using multiple tools to cross-verify findings.

### 5. Benefits of Using IntelliJ Profiler
The main benefits of using IntelliJ Profiler for profiling application code include providing in-depth analysis of application performance, seamless integration with the IntelliJ IDE, real-time performance monitoring and analysis, and quickly identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks.

### 6. Handling Inconsistent Results
When profiling results from IntelliJ Profiler are not entirely consistent with findings from performance testing using JMeter, it is important to cross-verify results using multiple profiling and testing tools, ensure the testing environment is consistent with production, and perform iterative testing and profiling to identify and resolve discrepancies.

### 7. Strategies for Optimizing Application Code 
After analyzing results from performance testing and profiling, strategies for optimizing application code include refactoring inefficient code, I tried to make it so that the code have the fastest running time and the most efficient. To make sure that the functionallity stays the same, i do a lot of testing so that the functionallity of each method stays the same, before and after oprimization.
